If you're coming for the weekend, here are a few places to visit and things to do. 

## Swimming

Lake, river or pool? 

* Georgian Bay is 20 minutes away. There are family friendly beaches in Thornbury and at Craigleith. 
* Slabtown has an amazing swimming hole on the Beaver River, about 12 minutes from our house.  Here's a map. 
* There's another swimming hole on the Beaver River, closer to Kimberley. 
* Oh and we have a little pool, so bring your swimsuit to our place. 

## Hiking

We live on the Niagara Escarpment.  The Bruce Trail is minutes away, and curves all over the area.  For a short easy hike, park at the top of Old Baldy and hike 15 minutes to see big views over the Beaver Valley. 

Closer to home, the Kolapore Wilderness Trails have amazing views, and overlap with the Bruce Trail.  

## Biking

We have the best biking options in Southern Ontario, whether you're into road, gravel, or singletrack.
